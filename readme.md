# P2p Lunes

The P2P Lunes project is a decentralized initiative that enables the trading of crypto assets Lunes through smart contracts, accepting any type of currency. In the event of a conflict between P2P parties, it will be necessary to open a dispute, subject to a small fee for mediation.

## About the Project

The project arose from the need for anonymity in currency trading, offering the convenience of acquiring the desired asset more quickly, securely, and entirely in a decentralized manner. This is made possible through the use of smart contracts, where the traded assets are recorded.
